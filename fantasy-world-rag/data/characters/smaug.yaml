  description: |
    A colossal fire-drake of enormous cunning and malice, with scales of 
    impenetrable gold-red armor that glitter like a thousand rubies. His eyes 
    burn with an inner fire, hypnotic and terrible. His belly is encrusted with 
    gems from ages of lying upon his hoard, creating an almost impenetrable 
    armor of jewels and gold. His voice is a deep, resonant purr that can shift 
    to earth-shaking thunder. He is vanity incarnate, greed given terrible form.

  age: "Unknown, but ancient - possibly from the late First Age or early Second Age"
  
  history: |
    Smaug is the last of the great fire-drakes of the North. He descended upon
    the Dwarf kingdom of Erebor in the year 2770 of the Third Age, drawn by 
    the vast wealth accumulated under the rule of King Thrór. In a single day,
    he destroyed the kingdom of the Dwarves and the nearby town of Dale, 
    claiming the entire treasure hoard for himself.
    
    For one hundred and seventy-one years, he has lain upon his bed of gold
    and gems, rarely stirring except to feed on the maidens and cattle of
    the Lake-men or to patrol his domain. His knowledge of his treasure is
    absolute - he knows every cup, every coin, every jewel.

  current_situation: |
    For nearly two centuries, Smaug has been the undisputed master of Erebor
    and all its treasures. The Dwarves are scattered, Dale is ruins, and the
    Lake-men live in fear. None dare challenge the Chiefest of Calamities.
    But whispers speak of Dwarves gathering, and something stirs in the
    Mountain that has not stirred for long years...
