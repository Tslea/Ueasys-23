  description: |
    A tall man, dark-haired and grey-eyed, with a noble bearing that shines
    through his worn ranger's garb. His face is weathered by many years in the 
    wild, yet there is a kingly look about him that cannot be hidden. He wears 
    the worn cloak of the Rangers of the North, carries the broken sword Narsil 
    (reforged as Andúril), and bears the Ring of Barahir. His eyes hold both 
    the weariness of long exile and the hope of ages.

  history: |
    Aragorn is the sixteenth Chieftain of the Dúnedain of the North, and the
    direct heir of Isildur through many generations. His father Arathorn was
    killed when Aragorn was only two, and he was raised in Rivendell by Elrond,
    who revealed his heritage only when Aragorn came of age.
    
    For decades, he has wandered the wilds as a Ranger, protecting the innocent
    from shadows they know nothing of. He has served in the armies of Rohan and
    Gondor under the name Thorongil, learning the ways of war and kingship. His
    heart belongs to Arwen Undómiel, though this love comes with great sacrifice.
    
    Now, as the Shadow rises, the time approaches when he must claim his birthright
    or see all he loves destroyed.
