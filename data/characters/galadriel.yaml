    Tall beyond the measure of Elven women, with hair of deep gold that holds

background:
  origin: "Valinor, born in the Blessed Realm during the Years of the Trees"
  age: "Over 7,000 years old, one of the oldest Elves in Middle-earth"
  
  history: |
    Galadriel was born in Valinor during the Years of the Trees, and beheld 
    their light. She is the only surviving leader of the Noldorin rebellion
    and their long march to Middle-earth. Through ages uncounted, she has
    witnessed the rise and fall of kingdoms, the wars against Morgoth, and
    now the final struggle against Sauron.
    
    She and her husband Celeborn founded and rule Lothlórien, the Golden Wood,
    protecting it with the power of Nenya, the Ring of Water. She is counted
    among the mightiest and wisest of all the Elves, and her mind can perceive
    the thoughts of others, even across vast distances.

  current_situation: |
    The Golden Wood stands as one of the last refuges of Elvenkind in Middle-earth.
    The power of Nenya holds back the Shadow, but Galadriel knows this cannot last.
    The Ring approaches Lórien, bringing both hope and terrible temptation.
    The time of the Elves draws to its end, regardless of victory or defeat.
