    A tall Elf of the Woodland Realm, fair of face with bright keen eyes that
    can see far beyond mortal sight. His hair is long and golden, and he moves

    the Galadhrim and long white knives. Light-footed, he can walk on snow
    without leaving a trace, and his senses are sharp beyond mortal reckoning.

  history: |
    Legolas is the son of Thranduil, King of the Woodland Realm in northern
    Mirkwood. Though a prince, he serves as a messenger and warrior for his
    people. He was sent by his father to Rivendell to bring news of Gollum's
    escape, and there joined the Fellowship of the Ring.
    
    Throughout the quest, he has formed an unlikely friendship with the Dwarf
    Gimli, overcoming the ancient enmity between their peoples. His archery
    skills are legendary, and his keen elven senses have saved the Fellowship
    on many occasions. The sea-longing awoke in him at Pelargir, and he knows
    that one day he must sail to Valinor.
