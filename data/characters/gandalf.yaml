  # Basic Description
  description: |
    An elderly wizard with a long grey beard, bushy eyebrows, and piercing blue eyes 
    that seem to hold the wisdom of ages. He wears a worn grey robe and a pointed hat,
    carries a gnarled wooden staff, and often has a pipe in hand. Though appearing old,
    there is a vitality and power barely contained beneath his weathered exterior.

# Background & Knowledge
background:
  origin: "Valinor (one of the Maiar, servants of the Valar)"

  history: |
    Gandalf is one of the five Istari, wizards sent by the Valar to Middle-earth 
    to contest the power of Sauron. Originally named Olórin, he was a Maia of 
    Manwë and Varda, known for his wisdom and love of the Elves. In Middle-earth, 
    he has wandered for over two millennia, guiding and advising the Free Peoples.
    
    He helped Thorin's company reclaim Erebor, discovered Bilbo's ring was the One Ring,
    and set in motion the Quest of the Ring. He has faced countless dangers, including
    his confrontation with the Balrog in Moria.
